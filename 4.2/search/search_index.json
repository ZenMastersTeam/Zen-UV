Margin \uf0c1 Set space between Islands for Pack Islands operation. Tip It\u2019s important to have enough space (Margin) between UV Islands to avoid visual artefacts connected with texture filtering in game engine renders. Here are suggested Margin values to use for different size textures: 256 - 2px 512 - 4px 1024 - 8px 2048 - 16px 4096 - 32px 8192 - 64px UV Coverage \uf0c1 Calculate Islands UV Coverage for active UV map. Increasing UV Coverage value leads to the increasing Texel Density value, this in turn leads to the more efficient UV space usage and you can see more pixels on your model using the same texture. The algorithm calculates total UV Islands area and shows the percentage in relation to the UV space. It can lead to the values more than 100% if you have Stacked Islands. Tip To increase UV Coverage value and achieve efficient UV space usage (80-90% of UV Coverage): Cut big Islands into smaller pieces if you have too much empty space. Upscale small objects on UV map to fill empty space. Downscale UV Islands that are barely visible on the model (e.g. bottom, back parts, etc.).

Trim sheets are a way to texture many assets with just a single set of textures, allowing for very efficient use of texture memory. The Trim Sheet process is basically creating a texture that allows you to apply different details (from the same texture) to a model. This texture can be used on multiple objects, or even just one large one, with fantastic quality results. Most AAA games use this technique a lot on environment assets in order to have fantastic quality, save time on development, keep assets together with a set theme, and many other reasons. Why would you use a trim sheet? \uf0c1 The main thing which make trim sheets valuable is their reusability. If you have a scene with lots of recurring elements those are ideal candidates for a trim sheet. Create your trim sheet with Zen UV \uf0c1 Zen UV addon provides all necessary tools to create your trim sections Preview Create your trim sheet in any 2D Vector Editor that supports SVG \uf0c1 We didn\u2019t want trim sheets system to be enclosed only in Blender. So we implemented very convenient import-export trim sheets into SVG files and back. If you are a PRO in such vector editor as Inkscape, feel free to create trim sheets in your favourite software and then just export it in SVG and import in Blender. Svg Share your trim sheets as SVG files \uf0c1 Sometimes sharing trim sheets as blend files is inconvenient, it requires matching Blender versions, cutting all unnecessary information not related to trim sheets, etc. So we implemented easy share trim sheets as SVG files. They can be viewed in any browser and can be edited not only in Blender but in every 2D Vector Editor. Export trim sheets to Substance 3D Designer \uf0c1 Substance 3D Designer is the industry standard for procedural textures creation. You can create Trim textures in this software using masks from Zen UV add-on. Tip Watch the video explaining How to export Trim sheets to Substance 3D Designer . Import trim sheets from DECAL Machine add-on \uf0c1 DECAL Machine is Blender add-on for Decal and Trim sheets creation.

The result of its operation depends on what was selected at the time it was run. Basic rules: \uf0c1 The operator does not work in the UV Sync Selection Off mode of the UV Editor . The properties of the operator show the current selection mode. It matches Blender\u2019s selection mode. Use only a single mesh selection Mode (Vert, Edge or Face). Multiple Selection Modes will not work (Vert + Edge, etc.). The operator works the same way in the UV Editor and in the 3D Viewport . Zen Unwrap always operates on islands in the active UV Map. If the marking is disabled in the operator, the division into islands will still occur. Seams will remain and lead to desync of what is happening in UV Editor and 3D Viewport . Tip Zen Unwrup will ignore existing UV Borders if they are not marked as Seams. To mark them use Seams by UV Borders operator. To save not only UV Borders but Islands Tag Finished operator. Processing Mode \uf0c1 The main operating mode switch. Panel Whole Mesh . The processing will be done for the whole mesh. All already unwrapped islands will be re-unwrapped. Selected Only . Processing will only be performed on the mesh selection. Seam Switch . This mode will switch seams with subsequent unwrapping. Only selected edges with seams will be included in the switching process. The seams that are in the selection will be deleted (Unmarked). New seams will be assigned according to the selection mode (Face, Edge). Unfold Vertices . In this case, regardless of the Select Mode, any selection will be treated as vertices. Selected vertices will be relaxed. The behavior of the operator if nothing is selected: \uf0c1 For using this just make sure you have no selection and press the Zen Unwrap button. If nothing is selected, the operator assumes that you want to unwrap the whole mesh. This mode can be used if you have already marked seams in some way and just want to unfold islands. When you start the operator, it may already be in Processing Mode - Selected Only . In this case, you will get a warning that the entire meshes will be unwrapped. If this suits you - confirm your action by pressing Ok. In case you have no marked seams and nothing selected, the operator will offer options for creating seams. Select the one you want. The behavior of the operator if something is selected: \uf0c1 The main modes of operation are Face and Edge . Vertex mode is used as an auxiliary mode. Face selection mode. \uf0c1 This mode will create seams around the selected polygons. The entire mesh will be unwrapped based on the existing (and newly added) seams, depending on the Processing Mode . In fact, you will create a new island from the selected polygons. Edge Selection Mode. \uf0c1 In this mode, all selected edges will be marked as seams and then the mesh will be unwrapped. Vertex selection mode. \uf0c1 Working in Face or Edge mode makes changes to the selected islands anyway. If you need to unwrap an island without adding seams or splittings it, use Vertex selection mode. You can select only one vertex or several. This will tell the operator which island you want to work with. It is most convenient to use this mode together with the Processing Mode - Selected Only . Settings \uf0c1 Preferences Unwrap Method . Unwrapping method. Conformal . Fast algorithm that gives good results. Angle-Based . More accurate algorithm, but a bit slower. Mark Settings . Operator settings to enable automatic seam marking. See Mark Settings (Global Mode) for details. Fill Holes . Virtual fill holes in mesh before unwrapping, to avoid overlaps and preserve symmetry. Averaged Texel Density .

Max - Set to the maximal position of the loops. Averaged - Set to the averaged position of the loops. Min - Set to the minimal position of the loops. Offset - Indicates the offset of each next loop relative to the previous. Sorting begins on the left bottom. The red color indicates that the value is not zero. Start / End Position Sample: \uf0c1 Offset Sample: \uf0c1 Preset U/V Direction: \uf0c1 Properties Angle - If the slope of the edge is less or equal to this value, then the edge will be selected. Spacing - How to set the distances between the points of the loop. Please refer to the Advanced Properties to learn more. How to work Angle value: If angle 01 is less than angle 02 means the edge is aligned along the U axis. If opposite, then the edge is aligned along the V axis. If the value \u200b\u200bof the Angle: operator\u2019s properties are less than angle 01 , then the edge will not be selected. Preset Borders: \uf0c1 Properties Corners By: - How to detect corners of the Island. Corner - By corner vertices. Pinned - By pinned vertices. Pinned & Corners - By pinned and corner vertices. Length - How to calculate the length for each straightened border segment. UV - As a sum of UV edges length. Geometry - As a sum of mesh edge length. Short - As a distance from the first point to the last point of the edge loop. Border Offset - Offset all the vertices use the first point as a pivot. This leads to island scaling. Corner Sample: \uf0c1 A Corner Point - it\u2019s a point that has 2 connected edges. Pinned Point - it\u2019s a point that is pinned by Blender\u2019s native Pin operator.
