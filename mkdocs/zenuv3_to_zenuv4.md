## I have bought all Zen Add-ons (Zen UV 3, Zen Sets, Zen Dock, Zen BBQ). Can I get Zen Bundle for free with Zen UV 4 inside?

Yes, if you have Zen UV 3, Zen Sets, Zen Dock, Zen BBQ on one marketplace. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a free Bundle for those who have all our products but on different marketplaces (for example Zen UV 3, Zen Sets on Gumroad and Zen BBQ on Blendermarket) due to different marketplaces databases.

**Gumroad** 

Gumroad users (who have Zen UV 3, Zen Sets, Zen BBQ) automatically will receive an email with unique code to get Zen Bundle for free. All codes will be sent by May 5, 2023. If you haven't received the code by this date, please check your spam folder.

## I have one or two Zen Add-ons. Can I get discount code for Zen Bundle?

At the moment we do not provide discount codes if you have one or two products.

---

## Do I need to upgrade from Zen UV 3 to Zen UV 4 in order to retain the product support?

Don't worry, if you are completely satisfied with the functionality of Zen UV 3, you can continue to use it. We do not force users to upgrade and make additional payments.

Support for new versions of Blender and bug fixes for Zen UV 3 will remain. But new features will only be added in Zen UV 4.

---

## I see the Zen UV 4 product in my library on Blender Market but I can only access the Zen UV 3 files. What is the reason?

Such situation happens, if you purchased Zen UV 3 on Blender Market but you haven’t upgraded it to Zen UV 4 yet. 

The original  Zen UV 3 product on Blender Market became the Zen UV 4 product when the new update was released (with  Zen UV 4 files added as new product variants). The old Zen UV 3 product variants were unpublished but not removed, so that the users who purchased Zen UV 3 still have access to it.

---

## What Blender version Zen UV 4 will support?

Zen UV 4 supports Blender 2.93 and higher.
