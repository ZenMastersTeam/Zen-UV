# Texel Density

Texel Density (TD) refers to the number of texture pixels (texels) per unit of surface area on a 3D model in a video game. It is important for maintaining visual quality and reducing texture stretching or blurring when a model is viewed up close or from different angles. Higher TD means more detail and sharpness on the textures, but can also result in larger file sizes and performance issues.

Usually itâ€™s measured in pixels per centimeter (2.56px/cm) or pixels per meter (256px/m).
