## Independent Transform Operators

### Relax ![](img/icons/relax-1_32.png)

Allows to reduce the stretching the faces of the island. Uses three algorithms.

!!! Panel
    ![](img/screen/transform/relax.png)
     - **Zen Relax**. The algorithm is most suitable for organic objects.
     - **Angle Based**. Blender's native algorithm. Most suitable for the hard surfaces objects.
     - **Conformal**. Blender's native algorithm. Same as **Angle Based**, but much faster. However, can lead to undesired results if the island is complicated.

### World Orient.

Rotate Islands the way they are oriented on the Models. Each method (Organic/Hard Surface) uses a heuristic approach and correctly orients most of the Islands in its area.

!!! Panel
     ![](img/screen/transform/world_orient_props.png)

     - **Method: Hard Surface / Organic**. The orientation method is suitable for geometry types.
     - **Further orient**. Additional turn. Allows you to turn the island to a horizontal or vertical if the island is located at an angle in the model.
     - **Flip By Axis**. Allow changing direction of the island after basic orientation. Suitable if needed change orientation from legs to head for example.

### Randomize.
  Randomize the position, rotation, and scale of the islands or selected vertices.

!!! Panel
     ![](img/screen/transform/randomize.png)

### Quadrify Islands ![](img/icons/quadrify_32.png)

Straighten rectangular-shaped Islands.

!!! Preferences

       ![quadrify_op_props](img/screen/transform/quadrify_op_props.png)

    ![Quadrify_SelectedEdge](img/gifs/trasnform_operators/Quadrify_SelectedEdge.gif) 
    - **Mark Borders**. Mark borders as seams/sharp after Quadrify Island operation.
    - **Mark Seams**. Mark seam in case **Mark Borders** is on.
    - **Mark Sharp**. Mark sharp in case **Mark Borders** is on.
    - **Orient to**. How to orient Quadrified Islands.
        - **Initial**. Leave orientation as is.
        - **Vertical**. Set orientation vertical.
        - **Horizontal**. Set orientation horizontal. 
        ![Quadrify_Orient](img/gifs/trasnform_operators/Quadrify_Orient.gif)

     ![Quadrify_Pack_Pin](img/gifs/trasnform_operators/Quadrify_Pack_Pin.gif)
    - **Tag as Finished**. Tag Quadrified islands as finished.

!!! tip
    Tag Quadrified Islands as [**Finished**](unwrap.md#finishing-system) to preserve them from unwrapping. It's recommended to [**Tag as Finished**](unwrap.md#tag-finished) all manually changed Islands.

### Reshape Island

Changes the islandâ€™s shape depending on the preset. [Here is full information](operators/reshape_island.md) about Reshape Island.


!!! Panel
    ![](img/screen/transform/reshape_presets_collected.png)

    - **Selected**. Straighten the selected Edge Loops and relax not selected vertices.
    - **U Direction / V Direction**. Edges is aligned in the indicated direction.
    - **Borders**. Straighten the edges of the island in even lines according to the given parameters.

### Match and Stitch

Matching the position, rotation, and scale of Islands. Stitch the vertices together, if possible.
