## Independent Transform Operators

### Relax
![](img/icons/relax-1_32.png) Allows to reduce stretching of the faces of the island. Uses three algorithms

| --- |
| Relax |

!!! Properties
    ![](img/screen/transform/tr_relax_properties.png)

- **Method** - Unwrapping method
    - *Zen Relax* - The algorithm is most suitable for organic objects.
    - *Angle Based* - Blender's native algorithm. Most suitable for hard surface objects.
    - *Conformal* - Blender's native algorithm. Same as **Angle Based**, but much faster. However, can lead to undesired results if the island is complicated.
- **Select** - Select relaxed island
- **Correct Aspect** - Taking image aspect ratio into account

    Assistant operator - [**Select Linked Loops** - Selects all loops belonging to the mesh vertex based on any already selected loop](./select.md#select-linked-loops)


|Example of usage|
|---|
|![match and stitch screen 01](img/screen/transform/match_and_stitch_example_01.png)|

It is recommended that we always make the settings in sequence.
First, Match, and if we are satisfied, then turn on Stitch. Stitch can't fix mistakes made in Match. The algorithm works as follows:
- First, find the endpoints of both selections. In the picture, we got 2 groups marked as green lines:
    - 1 (AB)
    - 2 (CD)

- Now we take one of the islands and move it until the ends of the found segments match. We can get two variants.
    - C falls into B. D is in A. - The correct option (red arrows). We can turn on Stitch and finish the work.
    - C falls into A. D goes to B. - Incorrect option for our particular case (blue arrows).

- If we have a second case, we cannot turn on Stitch at this time. It will eventually do what it can, but we will get tangled edges. We need to "flip" one of the islands. This can be done using the **Reverse Base** or **Reverse Matched** option. It doesn't make much difference. Just choose the one that suits is better visually. Also, the island will not actually be turned over. Just A and B will change places. And that's it.

We can add the case when we are not satisfied with the island that the algorithm has chosen as a base. Change the **Base Island** parameter. This is an infinite cyclic value. If we have 2 islands selected, it will change the **Base Island** in turn.
