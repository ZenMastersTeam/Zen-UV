## Independent Transform Operators:
---
### Relax ![](img/icons/relax-1_32.png)

 - Allows to reduce the stretching the faces of the island. Uses three algorithms.
     - **Zen Relax** - The algorithm is most suitable for organic objects.
     - **Angle Based** - Blender's native algorithm. Most suitable for the hard surfaces objects.
     - **Conformal** - Blender's native algorithm. Same as **Angle Based**, but much faster. However, can lead to undesired results if the island is complicated.

---
### World Orient.

 - Rotate Islands the way they are oriented on the Models. Each method (Organic/Hard Surface) uses a heuristic approach and correctly orients most of the Islands in its area.
  
  ![](img/screen/transform/world_orient_props.png)

 - **Method: Hard Surface / Organic** - The orientation method is suitable for geometry types.
 - **Further orient** - Additional turn. Allows you to turn the island to a horizontal or vertical if the island is located at an angle in the model.
 - **Flip By Axis** - Allow changing direction of the island after basic orientation. Suitable if needed change orientation from legs to head for example.

---
### Randomize.
 - Randomize the position, rotation, and scale of the islands or selected vertices.

!!! Preferences
     ![quadrify_op_props](img/screen/transform/quadrify_op_props.png)
    
    - **By selected Edges** - Selected Edges will be used and marked as Seams during Quadrify Islands operation. Works only in edge selection mode.
    ![Quadrify_SelectedEdge](img/gifs/trasnform_operators/Quadrify_SelectedEdge.gif) 
    - **Mark Borders** - Mark borders as seams/sharp after Quadrify Island operation.
    - **Mark Seams** - Mark seam in case **Mark Borders** is on.
    - **Mark Sharp** - Mark sharp in case **Mark Borders** is on.
    - **Orient to: ** - How to orient Quadrified Islands.
      ![Quadrify_Orient](img/gifs/trasnform_operators/Quadrify_Orient.gif) 
          - **Initial** - Leave orientation as is.
          - **Vertical** - Set orientation vertical.
          - **Horizontal** - Set orientation horizontal.

    - **Average Texel Density** - Averaging the size for the processed islands.
    - **Pack Quadrified** - Pack Islands after Quadrify Islands operation.
    - **Pin Quadrified** - Pin Islands after Quadrify Islands operation.
     ![Quadrify_Pack_Pin](img/gifs/trasnform_operators/Quadrify_Pack_Pin.gif)
    - **Tag as Finished** - Tag Quadrified islands as finished.

!!! tip
    Tag Quadrified Islands as [**Finished**](unwrap.md#finishing-system) to preserve them from unwrapping. It's recommended to [**Tag as Finished**](unwrap.md#tag-finished) all manually changed Islands.

### Reshape Island

Changes the islandâ€™s shape depending on the preset. [Here is full information](operators/reshape_island.md) about Reshape Island.

- **Selected** -  Straighten the selected Edge Loops and relax not selected vertices.
- **U Direction / V Direction** - Edges is aligned in the indicated direction.
- **Borders** - Straighten the edges of the island in even lines according to the given parameters.

### Universal Control Panel

!!! Control
    **Universal Control Panel**

    ![Transform](img/screen/transform/UniversalControl.png)

    The universal control panel has logic and different functions for different types of transformation.

---
### Pivot.

 - The pivot of transformation.

![](img/screen/transform/tr_un_pivot.png)

### Mode.

 - The Mode of transformation. In the Elements mode transformation will be performed over vertices, edges, and faces.

## Transform Types:

### Transform type Move. ![](img/icons/transform-move.png)

![Transform](img/screen/transform/MainPanelMove.png)


!!! Info
    - Buttons of the [**Universal Control Panel**](#universal-control-panel) in the Transform type **Move** represent the direction of shifting.

#### Move Increment
 - The value on which the island will be shifted.

---
### Transform type Scale. ![](img/icons/transform-scale.png)

![Transform](img/screen/transform/tr_scale.png)

!!! Info
    - Buttons of the [**Universal Control Panel**](#universal-control-panel) in the Transform type **Scale** represent Points from where the island will be scaled.

#### Scale Mode:

![](img/screen/transform/tr_scale_modes.png)

#### Mode - **Axis**.

![](img/screen/transform/tr_scale_mode_axis.png)

 - **Scale** - The value of the scale of the island for each of the axes.
 - **Tuner** - System that helps change values quickly.
     - "D" - Increase by two times.
     - "H" - Decrease two times.
     - "R" - Reset value to 1.0 .
     - Lock. - The Lock mode allows changing values as one.

#### Mode - **Units**.

![](img/screen/transform/tr_scale_mode_units.png)

 - **UV Size** - The estimated width of the UV area.
 - **Desired size** - The size of which should be set for selected elements relative to UV area.
 - **G** - Grab desired size from current selection. Exist only in the 3D Viewort context. Can be used only for 2 vertices or for one edge selection.
 - **Horizontal / Vertical** - What mean the Desired Size.
